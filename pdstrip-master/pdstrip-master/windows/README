This directory contains the source code for the MS Windows program
PdStripGui. It has to be compiled and linked with the Salford FTN95
compiler. Although these files are licensed under the MIT license, the
resulting program is non-free as it links with the salflibc.dll of Silverfrost.

You can download the compiler free of charge for personal use from
www.silverfrost.com and compile this program, but because of the proprietary
DLL we cannot distribute a complete binary installation of PdStripGui on
SourceForge.


HOW TO RUN PdStripGui

1) copy pdstrip.EXE from the parent directory into this directory.
2) run PdStripGui.EXE.
